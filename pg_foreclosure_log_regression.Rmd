```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is the markdown for our attempts to predict the likelihood of foreclosure at the tract level using logistic regression.

## Data Setup

Load libraries.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scipen=999)
##install.packages("ggrepel")
##install.packages('ggthemes')
library(tidyverse)
#Necessary for date parsing.
library(lubridate)
#Necessary for column name cleaning.
library(janitor)
#Eventually necessary for visualization
library(ggthemes)
#Necessary for Census API calls.
library(tidycensus)
#Eventually necessary for visualizations.
library(ggplot2)
#Potentially necessary for cleaning.
library(ggrepel)
#Eventually necessary for visualizations.
library(tigris)
#Simple features.
library(sf)
#Eventually necessary for mapping.
library(ggmap)
```

We read in our cleaned and combined dataset.

```{r}
# Read in the initial dataset, setting a guess_max limit to improve the accuracy of the data types assigned to each column.
pg_foreclosures_per_tract <- read_csv("datasets/pg_foreclosures_per_tract.csv", guess_max = 173)
```
